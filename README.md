I'm a data scientist and graduate architect passionate about leveraging analytical skills to innovate across architecture and beyond. I specialize in creating insights from complex datasets, building machine learning models, and designing solutions that have a tangible impact. Some technologies and tools I enjoy working with include Python, SQL, Tableau, and PowerBI. I'm actively exploring how data science can be applied in diverse fields, from real estate to environmental sustainability.
